# KMSL - Keyboard and Mouse Simulation Language

KMSL (_Keyboard and Mouse Simulation Language_) is a simple, **win-platform**, dynamic, high-level interpreted programming language. Its syntax is inspired primarily by Python, with some elements borrowed from C++. KMSL was created by Pawelgit1234 in 2024–2025.

KMSL is designed for writing concise scripts that help automate tasks such as solving mathematical expressions, simulating mouse movements, and controlling the keyboard. It stands out for its simplicity and lightweight nature, making it an excellent choice for quickly writing automation scripts. By using KMSL, you can save significant time and effort, whether you're handling repetitive tasks or creating small, efficient programs.
